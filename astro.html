The three major types of galaxies are 
<ul>
<li>Spiral Galaxies</li>
<li>Elliptical Galaxies</li>
<li>Irregular Galaxies</li></ul>

<span class='container fluid p-3 m-3'><mark>Spiral Galaxies</mark>

The three main components that make up a spiral galaxy are the center called bulge, the disk that makes the arms and the last part is a halo. Now, what are galaxies that are spiral, they are basically a mesh of older stars where different components of the spiral hold some form of celestial bodies. 

They even include dust, gases, and even younger stars. If we were to look at our milky way, that too is a spiral where our Sun is in the arm of it. As far as the halo is concerned, it consists of stars that are old and is in a loose structural form.</span></div>


<div class='container m-3 p-2'>
<span class='container fluid p-3 m-3'>
<mark>Elliptical Galaxies</mark> As their name suggests, the shape of these galaxy types is in an elongated sphere shape where they are bulky in the center and then tapered towards the edges, giving it a disk shape. As for the light, it is greatest in the center and dims as we go further away from it. However light does not exist in clusters but it spread evenly throughout the galaxy, unlike spirals. 

This is in part due to the massive number of stars concentrated in the center, sometimes even more than 1 trillion stars. This is why most of the larger galaxies are elliptical galaxies. The starâ€™s age and light are not the same in different types of the galaxy, as for elliptical ones, the stars are relatively older and most of the time their temperature is lesser than that of our own Sun, giving them a reddish appearance.
